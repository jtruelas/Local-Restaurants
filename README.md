# Local Restaurants Project

## Description
This program utilizes CRUD functionality, API Endpoints, Routing, using Templates and Forms, as well as playing with styling and message flashing. Flask is the framework being used for this website. 

The purpose of creating this interactive website that lists "_local_" restaurants is to gain a stronger understanding of all of these parts which make up a website.

_Local_ is essentially meaning local to the user, this website __IS NOT__ meant to be accurate or even factual, as some of the restaurants or menu items can, and probably will, be made up.
